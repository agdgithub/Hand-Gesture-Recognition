# Hand-gesture-recognition-using-OpenCv-and-Cnn
Hand gesture recognition is a component of human computer interaction. It's applications are in field of robotics
,virtual reality, and sign language interaction. This project is the combination of OpenCv and Cnn model. OpenCv is used to capture the current frame from your webcam and further Cnn is used to classify the image in the current frame.


# How to run
1. Firstly run the Cnn file to generate the model 
2. Use the generated model in the Hand-gesture-OpenCv.py
3. Run the Hand-gesture-OpenCv file in spyder
4. A window will popup which will calculate the background, wait for the further instructions

# Note:
Hardware: A webcam or other source of hand gesture images.
Software: Python 3.6 or higher TensorFlow and Keras
libraries, OpenCV library, ImageDataGenerator library
